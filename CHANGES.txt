Release 0.3 - T.B.D.

  BREAKING CHANGES
  * Unpacker.Feed is removed. Use Unpacker.Create(Stream) and feed data to the passing Stream instead of Unpacker.
  * IUnpackable.UnpackFromMessage now takes Unpacker instead of MessagePackObject to be symmetric as IPackable and improve custom unpacking performance.

  FEATURES
  * Improve protobuf-net compatibility.
  * Add non-generic overload for MessagePackSerializer.Create().
  * Support WinRT (experimental, .NET Fx core only, that is, WinMD is not supported yet).
  * Add SerialializerGenerator which provides capability to generate pre-built serializer assembly.
  * Unpacker.ReadItem/UnpackSubtree makes easy to unpack collection as MessagePackObject.

  BUG FIXES
  * Fix 'sparse' declaration (i.e. field ids are not continuous on the objects' MessagePackDataMember attribute) causes deserialization error.
  * Fix synchronization related error.
  * Serializers respects IPackable/IUnpackable.
